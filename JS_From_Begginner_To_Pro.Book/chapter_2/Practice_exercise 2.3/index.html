        <h1>Practice Exercise 2.3</h1>

        <p> Write some code to calculate the hypotenuse of a triangle using the Pythagorean 
theorem when given the values of the other two sides. The theorem specifies that the 
relation between the sides of a right-angled triangle is a2 + b2 = c2.</p>
        <p>You can use prompt() to get the value for a and b. Write code to get the value from 
the user for a and b. Then square the values of both a and b before adding them 
together and finding the square root. Print your answer to the console.</p>
